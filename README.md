# 👋 Hello, I'm Nrleryx !

### 🚀 Polyglot Software Developer & Open Source Contributor

A self-driven polyglot developer focused on continuous improvement and writing clean, effective code across various domains—from enterprise Java solutions to game engine integrations.

### 🌟 Featured Achievement: Towny Contribution

I successfully contributed to a large and widely-used open-source project like the Towny plugin (Minecraft).

| Project | Contribution Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Towny** | **New Command Development** | Developed and merged the critical **`/town nearby`** command (PR #8040), which efficiently finds and sorts the 10 closest towns to a player based on distance. |

This contribution is solid evidence of my ability to deliver real-world optimization and work within large codebases.

### 💻 My Technical Stack
